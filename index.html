          Phase One of this website, I'm thinking of just flex box with some github/linkedin/personalwebsite links using font awesome icons. Simple sleek design in black/white. The idea is to be able to work on a collaborative project using git that we can propagate to a live website to showcase our work. I think it will help us get a job as well as show that we can work on large group projects autonomously. My vision at the fundamental level is that everyone is able to pull from the website and insert in their own personal information from a template. Later on, we can upgrade the way we do things to fit best practices, but we can immediately implement our learned skills on a longer term project that will bne useful to us even after graduation. I would like to collaborate on this project with everyone in the class (and/or at least have everyone fork/pull/push their own personal information up. 
          </p>

            Ideas for the future:
            <ul><li>Google Maps API Integration with location markers for our students based on area they would be willing to work/move</li>
                <li>Personal Website in browser comparison tool, with drop down names that shows two websites side by side</li>
                <li>database/keyword search</li>
                <li>salary demands filter</li>
                <li>tinder like interface that will show us name, photo, etc</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <div class="container"><div class="profiles">
            <h1>Kevin Yang</h1>
